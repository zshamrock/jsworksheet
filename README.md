JavaScript Simple Worksheet
===========
By no means perfect, but should work fine with the most proper written JavaScript (without hoisting). Just [try it](http://zshamrock.github.com/jsworksheet/) and see if it helps you understand JavaScript better.

You can use console.log() and alert() in the worksheet also if you want to.
